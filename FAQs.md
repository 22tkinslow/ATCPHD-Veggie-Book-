# Frequently-Asked Questions about VeggieBook

## What is VeggieBook?
VeggieBook is a user-friendly smartphone app that helps household cooks incorporate vegetables into meals and snacks.
It offers color-illustrated recipes that are anchored in one of ten vegetables, giving fresh ideas that help cooks get out of their kitchen rut.  

The recipes and food tips are customized to what each user wants. A series of questions (e.g. Do you want recipes for a microwave?
Do you want recipes that are kid-friendly?) posed by the app help users select content of interest. Users are asked to review all of the recipes
and tips that the app has selected, and have an opportunity to keep or drop each recipe.

The app also contains Secrets to Better Eating, illustrated, practical ideas to improve breakfasts, lunches, snacks, dinners, and shopping for food.  

The app is available for both Android phones and iPhones.


## Is the app available in any language other than English?
Yes.  The app is available in English and Spanish. Users can easily toggle back and forth between languages, if desired.


## What are some of the special features of VeggieBook?
The app is designed so that each user chooses the content that she/he wants to keep on the phone. Users can share recipes via email, text,
or social media platforms. Users can re-visit and re-make their VeggieBooks and SecretsBooks to include new content. Recipes use familiar
ingredients and emphasize taste appeal as well as healthiness.  

In addition, the app has been configured so that organizations can print users’ VeggieBooks and SecretsBooks, if desired. A demonstration of
the printing can be seen in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBmlMQ2QuEw) 15 minute video.

## Who built VeggieBook?
A team at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, University of Southern California (USC), built VeggieBook, with support
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Professional chefs contributed recipes. Recipes and Secrets have been family tested. 

Susan H. Evans, shevans@usc.edu and Peter Clarke, chmc@usc.edu are willing to talk, at no cost, with organizations to share insights from their field work.  


## Is there evidence that VeggieBook actually works?
Yes. VeggieBook has been reviewed by national public health bodies and the app is included in the [SNAP-Ed Toolkit](https://snapedtoolkit.org).
Studies show that, with the app, cooks use more vegetables, feel empowered by learning new kitchen skills, and find their children (age 9-14) eager
to start contributing to dinner preparations. Research documenting VeggieBook’s impact on household eating has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals.   


## Are there ways to read some of the academic articles published about the project?  
Yes.  Here are links to a few research papers about the app.

## How can my organization adopt the app and use it with our clients?
VeggieBook is freely available (in Open Source), without a license or fee. Any organization that wishes, can adapt the app by adding its
own content, logo, or other modifications.


## If my organization wants to adapt VeggieBook, how would we do that?
Your digital staff or vendor would download the Open Source repository here on GitHub. You can also contact TechEmpower: email: info@techempower.com
or phone: 310-524-1700. TechEmpower has deep experience with VeggieBook and can provide assistance with programming issues. TechEmpower is a
business and, understandably, charges for its services.   

Sustained and effective use of the app benefits greatly from dissemination efforts that include “human touches.” Susan H. Evans, shevans@usc.edu
and Peter Clarke, chmc@usc.edu, creators of the app, can talk with you, at no cost, about these issues.


## Where has VeggieBook been field tested?
VeggieBook has been used in Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, and California.

The app is now ready for even wider dissemination. 


##If my organization wanted to adopt the app, could we track how people use it?
Yes. VeggieBook has a backend analytics function that records each user’s
selection of app content. This function is part of the Open Source entry on GitHub.
